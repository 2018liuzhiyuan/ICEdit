    <p style="text-align: left;">We present In-Context Edit, a novel approach that achieves state-of-the-art instruction-based editing <b>using just 0.5% of the training data and 1% of the parameters required by prior SOTA methods</b>. The first row illustrates a series of multi-turn edits, executed with high precision, while the second and third rows highlight diverse, visually impressive single-turn editing results from our method.</p>

This repository will contain the official implementation of _ICEdit_.

# ⚠️ Tips

### If you encounter such a failure case, please **try again with a different seed**!

- Our base model, FLUX, does not inherently support a wide range of styles, so a large portion of our dataset involves style transfer. As a result, the model **may sometimes inexplicably change your artistic style**.

- Our training dataset is **mostly targeted at realistic images**. For non-realistic images, such as **anime** or **blurry pictures**, the success rate of the editing **drop and could potentially affect the final image quality**.

- While the success rates for adding objects, modifying color attributes, applying style transfer, and changing backgrounds are high, the success rate for object removal is relatively lower due to the low quality of the removal dataset we use.

The current model is the one used in the experiments in the paper, trained with only 4 A800 GPUs (total `batch_size` = 2 x 2 x 4 = 16). In the future, we will enhance the dataset, and do scale-up, finally release a more powerful model.

# 💼 Installation

## Conda environment setup

```bash
conda create -n icedit python=3.10
conda activate icedit
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -U huggingface_hub
```

## Download pretrained weights

If you can connect to Huggingface, you don't need to download the weights. Otherwise, you need to download the weights to local.

- [Flux.1-fill-dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/flux.1-fill-dev).
- [ICEdit-MoE-LoRA](https://huggingface.co/sanaka87/ICEdit-MoE-LoRA).

## Inference in bash (w/o VLM Inference-time Scaling)

Now you can have a try!

> Our model can **only edit images with a width of 512 pixels** (there is no restriction on the height). If you pass in an image with a width other than 512 pixels, the model will automatically resize it to 512 pixels.

> If you found the model failed to generate the expected results, please try to change the `--seed` parameter. Inference-time Scaling with VLM can help much to improve the results.

```bash
python scripts/inference.py --image assets/girl.png \
                            --instruction "Make her hair dark green and her clothes checked." \
                            --seed 42 \
```

Editing a 512×768 image requires 35 GB of GPU memory. If you need to run on a system with 24 GB of GPU memory (for example, an NVIDIA RTX3090), you can add the `--enable-model-cpu-offload` parameter.

```bash
python scripts/inference.py --image assets/girl.png \
                            --instruction "Make her hair dark green and her clothes checked." \
                            --enable-model-cpu-offload
```

If you have downloaded the pretrained weights locally, please pass the parameters during inference, as in: 

```bash
python scripts/inference.py --image assets/girl.png \
                            --instruction "Make her hair dark green and her clothes checked." \
                            --flux-path /path/to/flux.1-fill-dev \
                            --lora-path /path/to/ICEdit-MoE-LoRA
```

## Inference in Gradio Demo

We provide a gradio demo for you to edit images in a more user-friendly way. You can run the following command to start the demo.

```bash
python scripts/gradio_demo.py --port 7860
```

Like the inference script, if you want to run the demo on a system with 24 GB of GPU memory, you can add the `--enable-model-cpu-offload` parameter. And if you have downloaded the pretrained weights locally, please pass the parameters during inference, as in:

```bash
python scripts/gradio_demo.py --port 7860 \
                              --flux-path /path/to/flux.1-fill-dev (optional) \
                              --lora-path /path/to/ICEdit-MoE-LoRA (optional) \
                              --enable-model-cpu-offload (optional) \
```

Then you can open the link in your browser to edit images.



## ComfyUI Workflow

We extend our heartfelt thanks to @[judian17](https://github.com/judian17) for crafting a ComfyUI [workflow](https://github.com/River-Zhang/ICEdit/issues/1) that facilitates seamless usage of our model. Explore this excellent [workflow](https://github.com/River-Zhang/ICEdit/issues/1) to effortlessly run our model within ComfyUI. 

It appears that certain issues may arise during the usage process. However, our internally developed ComfyUI workflow is set to be released imminently, which will effectively resolve these problems.


### 🎨 Enjoy your editing! 



# Comparison with Commercial Models

<div align="center">
<div style="width: 80%; text-align: left; margin:auto;">
    <img style="width:100%" src="docs/images/gpt4o_comparison.png">
    <p style="text-align: left;">Compared with commercial models such as Gemini and GPT-4o, our methods are comparable to and even superior to these commercial models in terms of character ID preservation and instruction following. <b>We are more open-source than them, with lower costs, faster speed (it takes about 9 seconds to process one image), and powerful performance</b>.</p>
