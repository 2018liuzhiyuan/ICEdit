    <p style="text-align: left;">We present In-Context Edit, a novel approach that achieves state-of-the-art instruction-based editing <b>using just 0.5% of the training data and 1% of the parameters required by prior SOTA methods</b>. The first row illustrates a series of multi-turn edits, executed with high precision, while the second and third rows highlight diverse, visually impressive single-turn editing results from our method.</p>

This repository will contain the official implementation of _ICEdit_.

# Installation

## Conda environment setup

```bash
conda create -n icedit python=3.10
conda activate icedit
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Download pretrained weights

If you can connect to Huggingface, you don't need to download the weights. Otherwise, you need to download the weights to local.

- [Flux.1-fill-dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/flux.1-fill-dev).
- [ICEdit-MoE-LoRA](https://huggingface.co/sanaka87/ICEdit-MoE-LoRA).

## Inference in bash (w/o VLM Inference-time Scaling)

Now you can have a try!

> Our model can **only edit images with a width of 512 pixels** (there is no restriction on the height). If you pass in an image with a width other than 512 pixels, the model will automatically resize it to 512 pixels.

> If you found the model failed to generate the expected results, please try to change the `--seed` parameter. Inference-time Scaling with VLM can help much to improve the results.

```bash
python scripts/inference.py --image assets/girl.png \
                            --instruction "Make her hair dark green and her clothes checked." \
                            --seed 42 \
```

Editing a 512Ã—768 image requires 35 GB of GPU memory. If you need to run on a system with 24 GB of GPU memory (for example, an NVIDIA RTX3090), you can add the `--enable-model-cpu-offload` parameter.

```bash
python scripts/inference.py --image assets/girl.png \
                            --instruction "Make her hair dark green and her clothes checked." \
                            --enable-model-cpu-offload
```

If you have downloaded the pretrained weights locally, please pass the parameters during inference, as in: 

```bash
python scripts/inference.py --image assets/girl.png \
                            --instruction "Make her hair dark green and her clothes checked." \
                            --flux-path /path/to/flux.1-fill-dev \
                            --lora-path /path/to/ICEdit-MoE-LoRA
```

## Inference in Gradio Demo

We provide a gradio demo for you to edit images in a more user-friendly way. You can run the following command to start the demo.

```bash
python scripts/gradio_demo.py --port 7860
```

Like the inference script, if you want to run the demo on a system with 24 GB of GPU memory, you can add the `--enable-model-cpu-offload` parameter. And if you have downloaded the pretrained weights locally, please pass the parameters during inference, as in:

```bash
python scripts/gradio_demo.py --port 7860 \
                              --flux-path /path/to/flux.1-fill-dev (optional) \
                              --lora-path /path/to/ICEdit-MoE-LoRA (optional) \
                              --enable-model-cpu-offload (optional) \
```

Then you can open the link in your browser to edit images.

### ðŸŽ¨ Enjoy your editing! 



# Comparison with Commercial Models

<div align="center">
<div style="width: 80%; text-align: left; margin:auto;">
    <img style="width:100%" src="docs/images/gpt4o_comparison.png">
    <p style="text-align: left;">Compared with commercial models such as Gemini and GPT-4o, our methods are comparable to and even superior to these commercial models in terms of character ID preservation and instruction following. <b>We are more open-source than them, with lower costs, faster speed (it takes about 9 seconds to process one image), and powerful performance</b>.</p>
